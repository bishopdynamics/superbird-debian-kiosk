# Change Log

v1.9

With this release you MUST re-setup host device and re-flash superbird.
The only supported host device is now `Raspberry Pi Zero 2W` with `Raspberry Pi OS Legacy (Bullseye) 64bit Lite`

changes:

- switched to Debian Bullseye
  - reduce superbird storage usage from 1.5GB -> 1.2GB
  - older chromium is more performant without gpu
- changed boot logo to Home Assistant icon
- xorg now defaults to NOT sleeping
- separate images for portrait and landscape (different boot logo)
- passwordless ssh key from host -> superbird
- renamed "chromium" service to "browser"
  - `/lib/systemd/system/chromium.service` -> `/lib/systemd/system/browser.service`
  - `/scripts/chromium_settings.sh` -> `/scripts/browser_settings.sh`
  - `/scripts/start_chromium.sh` -> `/scripts/start_browser.sh`
  - `/var/log/chromium.log` -> `/var/log/browser.log`

v1.8

- customized the boot logos a little bit, using [`aml-imgpack`](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/aml-imgpack)

v1.7

- switch from `x11vnc` to `tigervnc-scraping-server` for better vnc performance
  - default password `superbird`, to change: `sudo vncpasswd /scripts/vnc_passwd`, and `sudo systemctl restart vnc.service`
  - vnc password now survives upgrade via `update_local.sh`

v1.6

- `build_image.sh` can now create full image from a stock dump without extra steps
- `image_config.sh` now contains all user-configurable values for building and updating image
- the 256MB `settings` partition is now mounted at `/config/`, used for chromium user profile
- reorganize files to make it clearer where they go

v1.5.1

- fixed oops: missing `/scripts/chromium_settings.sh` in prebuilt image

v1.5

- moved chromium settings into separate file `/scripts/chromium_settings.sh`
- added buttons service, configure in `/scripts/buttons_settings.py`
  - need to provide your Home Assistant url, and long-lived token
  - control a light entity brightness by turning knob, pressing toggles on/off
  - recall scene/automation/script using buttons along edge, and button next to knob
- ditched the heredoc'd files in `install_debian.sh`, reorganized files needed for it
- added `update_local.sh` which can update an already-running local device running a previous release

Starting with this release, your settings are stored in `/scripts/chromium_settings.sh` and `/scripts/buttons_settings.py`, and those two files will NOT be touched during subsequent upgrades using `update_local.sh`, so your settings will survive upgrades.
However, your existing settings will NOT be migrated, so if you use `update_local.sh` to upgrade an existing device you will then need to edit those two files.

You should setup ssh key with superbird first, so that you don't have to type the password a bunch of times during upgrade.

If you are coming from v1.2 you should flash the image from Releases instead, you will end up with much more free space.

v1.4

- added back some python packages for fun
- added `--local_proxy` flag to `install_debian.sh`, to use a local instance of apt-cacher-ng
- added some helper scripts for creating an image for release
- switch to main debian mirror, `http://deb.debian.org/debian/`
- use x11vnc `-loop` flag instead of our own loop
- remove ~10px black border around chromium (more pixels!)
- hide scrollbars in chromium
- chromium service (including X11) now logs to `/var/log/chromium.log`

v1.3

- hide cursor in chromium
- add xorg.conf entries for buttons and knob
- fix issue with landscape touch input doubling
- remove a couple unnecessary packages to free up space
- fix incorrect kernel modules in /lib/modules
- remove unnecessary hardcoded chromium width and height
- remove unnecessary hardcoded vnc server width and height
- make vnc survive restart of X11
- clear display when chromium.service stops

v1.2

- initial release
